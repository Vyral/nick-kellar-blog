A lot of the time when people ask me about home renovations, they want to know what they can do to improve their market value. However, today I wanted to talk about a few renovations that you should avoid, as they can actually take value away from your home.

1. **Too much wallpaper**: One of the latest trends in new construction homes is to add a little bit of wallpaper here and there to accent certain rooms. However, too much wallpaper will scare buyers away, so don’t wallpaper entire rooms and definitely avoid outdated wallpaper.

2. **Lavish light fixtures**: Replace gaudy brass fixtures with the subtle, brushed bronze or the brushed nickel look. Flashy, over-the-top light fixtures draw the eye and distract buyers from the rest of the room.

3. **Textured walls and ceilings**: These are very difficult to paint over and don’t look great, either. Avoid textured walls and ceilings as much as possible.

4. **Too many different kinds of flooring**: If you go into a house and see carpet in one room, hardwood in another, tile in another, and then a different kind of hardwood, the home seems disjointed. You don’t need to replace all of the flooring; in fact, you will get the best ROI by just replacing some of the flooring in order to create a better flow from one room to the next.

5. **Too much carpeting**: These days, people prefer hardwood because it is easier to clean up, doesn’t trap as much dirt, and is more allergy-sensitive than carpeting.

6. **Bold wall colors**: You have probably heard this on HGTV, but you need to stay away from bold colors. Red, deep blue, or purple might work with your home decor but it won’t appeal to a lot of buyers, so stick to soft earth tones such as greens, tans, and grays accented with white trim.

7. **Hot tubs or swimming pools**: In certain price points and on certain lot sizes, a pool or hot tub can be an advantage. However, if the pool is crammed into the corner of a small yard, it can be detrimental to your property value. Before you install a hot tub or swimming pool, make sure you consult with a professional.
